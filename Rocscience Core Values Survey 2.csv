I think some of the questions in the survey may have been focusing on trying to observe change in the company's behavior since the introduction of the values. Rocscience had excellent implicit core values to begin with. It's hard to write down guiding values for a culture since it's a complex and evolving thing. I believe that writing them down should be an attempt to highlight what makes us special and what we have always done to serve as a guiding light, but I wouldn't expect it to change our behavior much, especially since Rocscience has been living these principles for many years, and our culture as a whole is much more nuanced than just 5 values.
